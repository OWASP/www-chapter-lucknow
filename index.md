## Welcome to OWASP Lucknow

OWASP Lucknow is the official Local Chapter of the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) in Lucknow, India. We are a community of security professionals, developers, students, and enthusiasts united by a shared mission: to improve software security through open collaboration, continuous learning, and practical action.

As part of OWASP’s global network of chapters, we bring world-class application security knowledge and best practices to the local community, helping individuals and organizations build more secure software systems.

Our chapter regularly hosts meetups, hands-on workshops, technical talks, and collaborative hacking sessions. These activities are designed to help participants build real-world skills, explore emerging threats and defenses, and connect with peers across the application security ecosystem.

## What We Do

We focus on creating a strong and inclusive application security community in Lucknow through the following initiatives:

**Community Events**  
Regular meetups featuring experienced speakers, interactive demonstrations, and knowledge-sharing sessions on current security topics.

**Practical Workshops**  
Hands-on training covering secure coding practices, threat modeling, defensive tooling, DevSecOps, API security, and cloud security.

**CTFs & Labs**  
Capture The Flag challenges and guided labs that allow participants to practice offensive and defensive techniques in a collaborative environment.

**Collaborative Projects**  
Opportunities to contribute to OWASP initiatives and open-source security tools, supported by mentorship and peer collaboration.

## Participation

Participation in OWASP Lucknow events and activities is **free and open to everyone**. No prior OWASP membership or registration fees are required. Whether you are a student beginning your journey in application security, a developer strengthening secure design skills, or an experienced professional sharing expertise, you are welcome to join.

We encourage participants to actively engage, learn, network, and contribute to the community. Those who wish to further support OWASP’s global mission are encouraged to become members of the OWASP Foundation.
